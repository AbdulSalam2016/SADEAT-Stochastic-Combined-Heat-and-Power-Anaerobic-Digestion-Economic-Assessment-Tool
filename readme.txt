Abstract. 	
Deterministic approaches to analyzing the economic feasibility of 
anaerobic digestion (AD) projects can lead to non-robust results. 
Stochastic approaches are inherently robust because they simultaneously 
explore multiple stochastic AD variables based on their probability 
distributions. However, few research papers on AD economics have used a 
stochastic approach in part due to the unavailability of tools for 
doing so. This paper presents a freely available stochastic AD economic 
assessment tool (SADEAT) to help academics and private firms interested 
in robustly assessing the economic feasibility of AD projects and/or 
policymakers seeking to explore policy options for the industry
